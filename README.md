Task 1 of my Web development and Designing internship at Oasis Infobyte.


ðŸ“Œ Project Title:Landing page 

This landing page project, titled "Rich Cuisine," is a testament to the foundational understanding of HTML and CSS, showcasing a visually appealing and functionally robust design. Let's delve into the key points and challenges inherent in this project:

ðŸ‘‰ KEY POINTS:

1.Title and Navigation: The page begins with a striking title, "Rich Cuisine," followed by a navigational bar presenting essential links such as Home, About, Menu, Gallery, Team, Contact, and Reservation.

2.Content Section: A well-structured content section welcomes visitors with a compelling message, "Welcome to Rich Cuisine," accompanied by a bold statement emphasizing the restaurant's focus on "Rich Healthy and Natural Food."

3.Search Functionality: The addition of a search bar enables users to easily find specific food items, enhancing user experience and engagement.

4.Submit Button: A prominent "Submit" button is strategically placed, likely intended for user feedback or other interactive functions. 

ðŸ‘‰ DESIGN CHALLENGES:

1.Background Image: Integrating a background image while ensuring readability and visual appeal presents a challenge. The use of CSS properties like background-size and background-blend-mode helps to maintain a balanced aesthetic.

2.Navigation Styling: Achieving visually appealing navigation links with hover effects requires careful consideration of CSS properties such as color, padding, and transition duration.

3.Content Alignment: Positioning content elements such as headings and paragraphs to achieve a balanced layout amidst varying screen sizes and resolutions demands precise CSS positioning techniques.

4.Input and Button Styling: Consistently styling form inputs and buttons across different sections of the page requires attention to detail and adherence to a cohesive design language.

5.Responsive Design: Ensuring responsiveness across devices poses a significant challenge. Employing CSS media queries to adapt the layout and styling for various screen sizes is crucial to maintaining a seamless user experience.

6.Color Scheme and Contrast: Selecting an appropriate color palette and ensuring sufficient contrast between text and background elements is essential for readability and accessibility.
